## PiGoAi

A modular, LEGO-framed personal AI core — Pi-powered, memory-enabled, and future-ready for robotics platforms.

### Vision
PiGoAi is a personal assistant AI housed in a customizable LEGO shell, designed to learn you specifically, dock with different platforms (robotic base, control hub), and be extended with modules.

### Current Status
- Repo created
- Project concept defined

### Next Steps
- Brain shell prototype CAD
- Power & Pi integration
- Basic Python module structure
